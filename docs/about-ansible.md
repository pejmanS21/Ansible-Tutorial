# About Ansible ðŸ¤–

!!!info
		Tool to automate IT tasks

### Why use Ansible?

For example you have 10 servers and want to deploy a new version of an app on it, or update Docker on them. So you have to ssh to those servers and do it by yourself and itâ€™s time consuming.

1. Execute tasks from your own machine
2. _Configurations_ | _Installation_ | _Deployment_ step in a single `YAML` file
3. Re-use same file for different environments
4. More reliable & less likely for errors

!!!info
		**Ansible** supports all infrastructure and it is **agentless.**

## Ansible Playbooks

```yaml
tasks:
	- name: a task in postgres  # Description of task
		postgresql_table:         # Module name
			table: foo              # Arguments
			rename: bar             # Arguments

	- name: change owner # Description of task
		postgresql_table:  # Module name
			name: foo        # Arguments
			owner: newuser   # Arguments
```

### Execute multiple modules in a sequence

```yaml
tasks:
	- name: create dir for nginx
		file:
			path: /path/to/nginx
			state: directory

	- name: install latest nginx
		yum:
			name: nginx
			state: latest

	- name: start nginx
		service:
			name: nginx
			state: started
```

### Where to execute tasks and who execute them?

```yaml
- hosts: databases
	remote_user: root
	vars:
		tablename: foo
		tableowner: newuser

	tasks:
		- name: rename table from {{ tablename }} to bar
			postgresql_table:
				table: {{ tablename }}
				rename: bar

		- name: change owner
			postgresql_table:
				name: {{ tablename }}
				owner: {{ tableowner }}
```
